# Icon Requirements

For the extension to work properly, you need to create and place the following icon files in this directory:

1. `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
2. `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
3. `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use the HTML Generator

1. Open the `generate_icons.html` file in your browser
2. Click the "Generate Icons" button
3. Right-click on each canvas and select "Save Image As..."
4. Save each icon with the correct filename in this folder

### Option 2: Use Online Tools

1. Visit a free icon generator website like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [iconifier.net](https://iconifier.net/)
2. Create simple icons at the required sizes
3. Download and save them with the correct filenames in this folder

### Option 3: Create Your Own

If you have design skills, create PNG icons that are:
- Square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Transparent background (if desired)
- At the exact dimensions listed above

## Another Solution

If you don't want to create icons right now, you can temporarily remove the icon requirements from the `manifest.json` file by editing it to remove the "default_icon" section.
